STRATEGY GUIDANCE:
- Track which tools have been reliable for which types of questions.
- The calculator is perfect for maths but useless otherwise.
- Web search can return popular but incorrect answers for common misconceptions.
- If two tools disagree, consider which has been more reliable for this question type.
- The knowledge base returning "no result" means the question may be outside \
common factual territory.
- Be especially careful with questions that SEEM simple but might be tricky.
- Only say "I don't know" if you genuinely can't determine the answer with \
reasonable confidence. The threshold: if you think there's less than a 1 in 3 \
chance you're right, abstain.

TOOL SELECTION:
- Don't query tools that are unlikely to help with this question type.
- Don't cross-verify unless the first result seems uncertain.
- Use the cheapest applicable tool first.
